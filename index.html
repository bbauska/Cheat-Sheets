<h2 style="text-align:left;"><font size="3" color="#000000"><span style="font-weight: normal;">As in other engineering discipline Any, software engineering HAS aussi some structured models for software development.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">This document will Provide you with a generic overview about different software development methodologies ADOPTED by</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">contemporary software FIRMS. Read on to know more about the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) in detail.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Curtain Raiser</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Like Any Other set of engineering products, software products are oriented aussi Towards the customer. Either it is market</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">driven or it drives the market. Customer Satisfaction and Customer Delight Were buzzwords Many decades ago.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Customer Co-creation is the new buzzword that's doing the rounds beens. Products That Are not customer or user friendly</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Have No place in the market although They are engineered using the best technology. The experience of the product and</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">the participation of the customer in Creating the product is as crucial as the internal technology of the product.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Market Research</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">A market study is made to Identify a potential customer's need. This process is known as aussi market research. Here, the</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Already Existing as possible and the need and potential needs That are available in a segment of the society are Studied</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">carefully. The market study is done based on a lot of Assumptions. Assumptions are the crucial factoring in the</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">development or inception of a product's development. Unrealistic Assumptions can because a nosedive in the Entire</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">venture. Though Assumptions are abstract, there shoulds be a move to economic development of tangible Assumptions to come up with a</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">successful product.</span><br><br><br><br><u>Research and Development</u><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Once the Market Research is Carried out, the customer's need is Given to the Research &amp; Development division (R &amp; D) to</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">conceptualize a cost-effective system That Could Potentially solve the customer's needs in a Manner That is better than the</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">one ADOPTED by the Competitors at present. Once the conceptual system is Developed and tested in a hypothetical</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">environment, the development team takes control of it. The development team Adopts one of the software development</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">That Is Given below methodologies, develops the Proposed System, and Gives it to the customer.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">The Sales &amp; Marketing division starts selling the software to the available customers and simultaneously works to</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">economic development of a Niche That Could Potentially segment buy the software. In addition, the division assists aussi feedback from the</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">the customers to the developers and the R &amp; D division to make value additions to be the product.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">While Developing a software, the company outsourced the non-core activities to other companies who specialize in Those</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">activities. This ACCELERATES the software development process Largely. Some companies work on tie-ups to bring out a</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">highly matured product in a short period.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Popular Software Development Models</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">The Following are some basic popular models That Are ADOPTED by Many software development FIRMS</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">A. System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Model</span><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">B. Prototyping Model</span><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">C. Rapid Application Development Model</span><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">D. Component Assembly Model</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">A. System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Model</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">This is known as aussi Classic Life Cycle Model (or) Linear Sequential Model (or) Waterfall Method. This model Has the</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Following activities.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">1. System / Information Engineering and Modeling</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">As software is always of a wider system (or business), work begins by the Establishing Requirements for all system</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">items and then allocating some subset of These Requirements to software. This system view is essential When the</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">software must interface with other items Such as hardware, people and other resources. System is the basic and very</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">critical requirement for the existence of software in Any entity. So if the system is not in place, the system shoulds be</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">engineered and put in place. In some cases, to extract the maximum output, the system shoulds be re-engineered and</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">spruced up. Once the ideal system is engineered or tuned, the development team studies the software requirement for</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">the system.</span><br><br><u>2. Software Requirement Analysis</u><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">This process is known as aussi feasibility study. In this phase, the development team visits the customer and studies Their</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">system. They Investigate the need for automation in the software can Given system. By the end of the Feasibility</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">study, the team furnishes a Document That holds the different specific recommendations for the candidate system. It aussi</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">includes the staff assignments, costs, project schedule, target dates etc. .... The requirement gathering process is</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Intensified and focussed specially on software. To Understand the Nature of the program (s) to be built, the system</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">engineer or "Analyst" must Understand the information domain for the software, as well as required function, behavior,</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">performance and interfacing. The essential purpose of this stage is to find the need and to define the problem That needs</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">to be solved.</span><br><br><u>3. System Analysis and Design</u><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">In this phase, the software development process, the software's overall structure and Its nuances are defined. In terms of</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">the client / server technology, the number of third needed for the package architecture, the database design, the data</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">structure design etc ... are all Defined in this phase. A software development model is created Malthus. Analysis and Design</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">are very crucial in the whole development cycle. Any glitch in the design stage Could be very expensive to solve in the</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">later course of the software development. Much care is taken falling on this phase. The logical system of the product is</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Developed in this phase.</span><br><br><u>4. Code Generation</u><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">The design must be translated into a machine-readable form. The code generation step performs this task. If the design is</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Performed in a detailed Manner, code generation can be accomplished without much complication. Programming tools</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">like compilers, interpreters, debuggers etc ... are used to generate the code. Different high level programming languages</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">like C, C + +, Pascal, Java are used for coding. With respect to the kind of application, the right programming language is</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Chosen.</span><br><br><u>5. Testing</u><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Once the code is generated, the software program testing begins. Different testing methodologies are available to</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">unravel the bugs COMMITTED That Were falling on the previous phases. Different testing tools and methodologies are Already</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">available. Some companies build Their own testing tools are tailor made for That Their own development operations.</span><br><br><u>6. Maintenance</u><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">The software will definitely change Undergo ounces it is Delivered to the customer. There can be Many Reasons for this</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">changes to Occur. Change Could Happen Because of some unexpected input values &#8203;&#8203;into the system. In addition, the</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">exchange in the system Could Directly affect the software operations. The software shoulds be Developed to Accommodate</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">That Could Happen exchange falling on the post implementation period.</span><br><br><u>B. Prototyping Model</u><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">This is a cyclic version of the linear model. In this model, the requirement oz analysis is done and the design for a</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">prototype is made, the development process gets started. Once the prototype is created, it is Given to the customer for</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">evaluation. The customer tests the package and gives his / her feed back to the developer who REFINES the product</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">selon the customer's exact expectation. After a finite number of iterations, the final software package is Given to the</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">customer. In this methodology, the software is as a result of Evolved periodic shuttling of information entre le</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">customer and developer. This is the MOST popular development model in the contemporary IT industry. Most of the</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">successful software products Have Been Developed using this model - as it is very difficult (even for a whiz kid!) to</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">comprehend all the Requirements of a customer in one shot. There are Many variations of this model skewed with respect</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">to the project management styles of the companies. New versions of a software product evolve as a result of prototyping.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">C. Rapid Application Development (RAD) Model</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">The RAD modelis a linear sequential software development process emphasizes That year extremely short development</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">cycle. The RAD model is a "high speed" adaptation of the linear sequential model in rapid development Which is</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Achieved by using a component-based approach building. Primarily used for information systems applications, the</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">RAD approach encompasses the Following steps:</span><br><br><u>1. Business modeling</u><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">The information flow is Modeled Among business functions in a way That answers the Following Questions:</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">What information drives the business process?</span><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">What information is generated?</span><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Who Generates it?</span><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Where does the information go?</span><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Who processes it?</span><br><br><u>2. Data modeling</u><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">The information flow Defined as share of the business modeling stage is refined into a set of data objects are needed That</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Support to the business. The characteristic (Called attributes) of each Stock object is APPROBATION and the Relationships between</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">thesis objects are defined.</span><br><br><u>3. Process modeling</u><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">The data objects in the data-Defined modeling stage are Transformed to Achieve the Necessary information flow to</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Implement a business function. Processing the descriptions are created for adding, Modifying, deleting, or retrieving a</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">data object.</span><br><br><u>4. Application generation</u><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">The RAD model assumed the use of the RAD tools like VB, VC + +, Delphi etc ... Rather Than Creating software using</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">conventional third generation programming languages. The RAD model works to reuse Existing program components</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">(When possible) or create reusable components (when necessary). In all cases, automated tools are used to Facilitate</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Construction of the software.</span><br><br><u>5. Testing and turnover</u><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Since the RAD process emphasizes reuse, Many of the program components Already Have beens tested. This minimizes</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">the development and testing time.</span><br><br><u>D. Component Assembly Model</u><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Object technologies Provide the technical framework for a component-based process model for software engineering.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">The object oriented paradigm emphasizes the establishment of classes encapsulate That Both data and the algorithm That Are</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">used to manipulate the data. If Properly Implemented and designed, object oriented classes are reusable across different</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">applicationsand computer based system architectures. Component Assembly Model leads to software reusability. The</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">integration / assembly of the Already Existing software components accelerate the development process. Many nowadays</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">component libraries are available on the Internet. If the right components are Chosen, the integration is made much appearance</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">simpler.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Conclusion</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">All different software development models thesis Have Their Own advantages and disadvantages. Nevertheless, in the</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">contemporary business software evelopment world, the fusion of all methodologies thesis is incorporated. Timing is</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">very critical in software development. If a delay happens in the development phase, the market Could be taken over by</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">the competitor. Also if a 'bug' filled product is Launched in a short period of time (quicker than the Competitors), it may</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">affect the reputation of the company. So, there shoulds be a tradeoff entre le development time and the quality of the</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">product. Customers do not expect a bug free product purpose They expect a user-friendly product That They Can give a thumbs-</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">up to.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Modals Software Development Life Cycle?</span><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Methodologies: -</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Agile Agile methods-Promote Generally a disciplined project management process That encouraged frequent inspection</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">and adaptation, a leadership philosophy That encouraged teamwork, self-organization and accountability, a set of</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Intended engineering best practices to allow for rapid delivery of high-quality software, and a business approach That</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">aligns development with customer needs and company goals.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Rad Modal: - Its Minimal planning in favor of rapid prototyping. The "planning" of software Developed using RAD is</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">interleaved with writing the software Itself. The Lack of extensive pre-planning allows software to be Generally written much</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">faster, and makes it Easier to changing requirements.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Modal Spiral: The spiral-methodology extends the waterfall model by Introducing prototyping. Generally it is</span><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Chosen over the waterfall approach for large, expensive, and complicated projects.At a high-level, the steps in the spiral</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">model are as follows:</span><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">The new system requirements are as Defined in much detail as possible. This Usually Involves interviewing a number of</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Representing all the external users or internal users and other aspects of the Existing System.</span><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">A preliminary design is created for the new system.</span><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">A first prototype of the new system is Constructed from the preliminary design. Usually this is a scaled-down system, and</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Represents approximate year of the characteristics of the final product.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Waterfall Method:-The name of the waterfall lifecycle model comes from icts physical appearance, Shown in Figure, and</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">the process by Which the results from one phase flow into the next. An alternative name for this model is the "Big Bang"</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Because working lifecycle APPEAR first results near the end of the process, scientists describe how something like the Big</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Bang theory of how the universe was created. The waterfall model is simple, easy to learn, and easy to use.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Modal V: - All the Necessary steps of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) are Followed. Most importantly, the stage</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">of Software Quality Assurance (SQA) is Executed with Utmost care. The life cycle used by us for application development</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">is as follows.</span><br><br><u>SDLC Phases?</u><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">The systems development life cycle (SDLC) is a conceptual model used in project management That Describes the</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Involved in training year information system development project, from initial feasibility study through year of the service</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">completed application.</span><br><br><br><u>&nbsp;SDLC Phases: -</u><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Schedule</span><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Everything starts with a concept. It could be a concept of someone, or everyone. However, there are Those That do not</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">start out with a goal concept with a question, "What do you want?" they ask Thousands of people in a community or some</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">age group to Know What They Want and decided to create an answer. Aim it all goes back to schedule and conceptualization.</span><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Requirement</span><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">In engineering, a requirement is a singular Documented need of what a Particular product or services or shoulds be</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">perform. It is MOST Commonly used in a formal sense in systems engineering or software engineering. It is a statement</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">That has identified Necessary attribute, capability, characteristic, or quality of a system in order for it to Have value and utility</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">to a user.</span><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Design</span><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Once the schedule and arguing with the manager or owner about the plane and somehow convincing em, it is time to</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">design or create a rough plane Regarding the software.</span><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Implemantion</span><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">The first two stages are quite common in all SDLC models. However, things change starting on this course. When the</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">design and all the things you need That Have Been laid out, it is time to work on the plan. Some developers, Especially</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Those That follow the standard plan of Developing Software will work on the plane and present em for approval.</span><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Testing</span><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Could this mean two things DEPENDING ON SDLC model year. The first kind of testing is the testing by actual users. This is</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Usually done in implementation models Wherein Does not go with pre-testing with users. On the other hand, there are aussi</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">That uses testing professionals in the field. This testing is Aimed in the cleaning of all the software bugs altogether. For</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">That software are set for public release, the software is first tested by other developers who Were not in charge in Creating</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">the software.</span><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Acceptance</span><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">When the software is released to be used by a company some, acceptance means clustering software is Implemented as the year</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Could be added tool or the replacing another software That too has-been found wanting Effective years of use. On the other hand,</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">When the software is to the public Implemented new software Could be an added software for use. It is difficulty to change</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">They are public purpose software not closing Their ears to new software. So developers will Always Have a fighting chance in</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">the market as long as They Implement Good software for public use.</span><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Maintinance</span><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">When the software is Implemented, It Does not mean que le software is good as it is. All models include SDLC</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">service since there are absolutely no way That will be a software working perfectly. Someone HAS to stay in the</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">this software to take a look and Ensure the program works perfectly. When the software is Implemented in</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Either set up companies public.Software a call center or an e-mail service to address the Concerns of the consumer. Ace</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">We have in previous chapters Indicated Maintenance is quiet an easy task as long as the right product is used as food and</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">year in expected time frame. However, it is always a challenge When something goes wrong. The whole team might not be</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">there to help the developer so Addressing a major concern Could never be answered.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Advantage and Disadvantage of SDLC modals?</span><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">SDLC models Advantages &amp; disadvantages</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Advantages of Waterfall Model</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">1.

Purpose for software products That Have Their feature sets redefined falling on development of user feedback and Because other factoring, the traditional waterfall model is no longer considers.<br />- The EVO Evolutionary development model divides the development cycle into smaller, incremental waterfall models in Which users are ble to get access to the<br />product at the end of each Stock cycle.<br />- Feedback is provided by the users on the product schedule for the course of the next cycle and the development team Responds, Often by changing the product, plans, or processes.<br />- These are incremental cycles two to four weeks Typically in duration and continuous Until the product is shipped.<br /><br /><br />Benefits of Evolutionary Development Model<br /><br />- Benefit not only business goal marketing results and internal operations as well.<br />- Use of EVO significant reduction in risk Brings for software projects.<br />- Reduce Costs by EVO can Providing a structured, disciplined avenue for experimentation.<br />- EVO allows the marketing department access to early deliveries, Facilitating development of documentation and demonstrations.<br />- Short, frequent cycles EVO have some distinct advantages for internal processes and people considerations.<br />- The cooperation and Flexibility required by each Stock EVO developer of Greater results in teamwork.<br />- Better fit the product to user needs and market requirements.<br />- Manage project risk with early cycle definition of happy.<br />- Uncover key issues early and careful focus Appropriately.<br />- Increase the opportunity to hit market windows.<br />- Accelerate sales cycles with early customer exposure.<br />- Increase management visibility of project progress.<br />- Increase productivity and product team motivation.<br /><br />The Journey<br /><br />At the Define stage of the DFSS methodology, we instigated the requirement drill down process of e-HOQ. The key activities Were:<br /><br />At level 1 of HOQ-e: Stakeholder Analysis - We APPROBATION the principle roles and actors related to the transformation program eg the business users, business sponsors, and other Concerned parties. The e-HOQ year ensured exhaustive list of Roles and Responsibilities.<br />At level 2 of HOQ-e: We used the e-HOQ analysis to the core business functions of the stakeholders and Their Assessed against each Stock stakeholder importance, APPROBATION in level 1.<br />At level 3 of HOQ-e: We used the e-HOQ to inefficient drivers for Assessment of each Stock core business functions, APPROBATION in level 2.<br />At level 4 of HOQ-e: We used the e-HOQ to Identify high level solution to resolve the characteristics inefficient drivers, APPROBATION in level 3.<br />At level 5 of HOQ-e: We used the HOQ-e to start the process of the user requirements Deriving from the solution characteristics, APPROBATION in level 4.<br />At level 6 of the HOQ-e: We used the e-HOQ to kick off the refinement process of the user requirements, APPROBATION in level 5, into technical requirements.<br />Measure at the stage of the DFSS methodology, we derive the metrics (Referred to as Critical To Quality - CTQs) required to measure conformance to the quality of the Proposed SLAs gold solution. The high level quality attributes are articulated by the business stakeholders and we used the GQ (I) M to derive the share of the Measurable quality attributes Which are Critical To Quality Called (CTQs).<br /><br />At level 7 of the HOQ-e: we employed the HOQ-e to the relationships entre le for Assessment Technical requirements, APPROBATION in level 6 of HOQ-e, and the CTQs derived by the GQ (I) M. At this level we how well for Assessment (defined by the CTQs) shoulds a function (defined by the technical requirement) performs. We are Malthus, ble to map the model with clear quality metrics with the technical requirements.<br />At the Analysis - Design stage of the DFSS methodology, we enter the design Wherein the technical requirements (level 7 of the HOQ-e) are translated into Testable Integration Architecture (TiA-e) models. These are the communication model or in terms UML component models of the Proposed solutions. In the context of this program, the models illustrated Were in BPMN 2.0 notation. The ZDLC Automatically preserves the traceability of the artifacts from level 1 (of HOQ-e) down to the TiA Models. The key activities Were:<br /><br />Using e-TiA: We build the simulation model based on the specification, the level prescribed by 7 of HOQ-e; e-TiA year produced accurate representation of the structural model of the Proposed Solution.<br />Using e-TiA: We use the pi-calculus formal compiler to verify the syntactical characteristics of the e-TiA model.<br />Using e-TiA: We calibrated and Validated TiA the model against the Requirements, APPROBATION in level 7.<br />Using e-TiA: We simulated the model against the CTQs APPROBATION in level 7 of the HOQ-e and the corrected model as required, Asking WHILST the business has vital question: "Is that what you Meant?"<br />Using e-TiA: Based on the corrected model, BPMN, UML State-charts and designs are generated and are Provided guidance to the development team for coding. The guidelines are unambiguous, hence reinforced the communication to the developers.<br />At the Validate stage of the DFSS methodology, we employed the Systemic Defect Profiler to Reduce the time taken to find the root cause of a defect. The key activities are:<br /><br />Using e-SDP: The SDP debug parser of e-has-been configured to interpret the log structure implementation of technology in place, and in our context it was Pega PRPC. Note SDP-e Requires at least five attributes from the Application logs, Which are 1) time-stamp, 2) session ID, 3) source component, 4) destination component and 5) the function call.<br />Using SDP-e: We setup the server for e-SDP to be Executed. SDP-e is Injected with run time application logs or debug logs data reverse engineered and That Is Automatically Examined against the TiA model. SDP-e generated a defect report with description of the year enriched root cause of the defect, Malthus aiding the developer to speed up the defect fix activity.<br />Benefits of DFSS tools with Coupling ZDLC<br /><br />Improved lifecycle THROUGHOUT Communication - The HOQ-e is a communication tool Predominantly, preserving the traceability of the Requirements down to the design specifications, available-to-any stakeholder, anywhere and anytime. The stakeholders Could Easily observe the tie-back Between requirement and business vision.<br />Reduced efforts to validate business requirement - Using the e-TiA models of the functions on each Stock Proposed solution can be tested against the user requirements to Ensure the business drivers are met. The efforts required for validating the Requirements are Reduced.<br />Reduced human errors Injected - The TiA-e models, corrected ounces, are used to generate the Automatically technical design documents. The process of the accelerated automation and documentation Avoided Injected human errors.<br />Reduced efforts to fix defects - SDP-e enriched the description of a defect with information related to the deviation between design time and run-time, helping the developer to trace the root cause of the defect faster than classical approach.<br /><br />The Story<br /><br />This story is about the motivation behind the Zero Deviation Life Cycle (ZDLC). A motivation driven by real business problems, Where projects are plagued by cost and schedule overrun and Requirements no longer resembled the gold business needs IT solutions failed to properly resolve the problems. Many methodologies Emerged, most is of Them tackled the issues of management Realising a rationalised development life cycle. Looked at the very FEW engineering units; That the shares define the quality and reliability of the end results, the hand That makes one proud of the product. There are several topics and line of thoughts written Towards the concepts of Application Lifecycle Management Within a new business dynamics. As a result, the motivation behind the ZDLC and Its origin is to propose the concept of Application Lifecycle Engineering (ALE). Because this is, management constraints cannot dictate how technical engineering are above all else and Applied, management constraints cannot sacrifice engineering methods for speed and time.<br /><br />ZDLC is about FTA, or "smart ALM". It complements all ALMS by Focussing on the engineering aspects of a typical Software Development Life Cycle, Advancing technology to Employ statistical and probabilistic models, formal methods, simulation and intelligent automation speed up the process That of Developing Software WHILST augmenting quality and productivity of the process . Yet all the scientific rigor is well hidden through clever abstractions and simplified user interface and experience of the tools.<br /><br />Many organizations seek to use ZDLC year in agile execution mode, automatic ZDLC Where Many of the tedious and time consuming software validation processes That may hinder agility. Goal this story is about year Which organization did not want to Implement agile wanted the goal of agility Their Existing Waterfall model (SDLC) to be Increased. This organization Shifted from year Agile execution model to Become a quality attribute of waterfall, and wanted best of both worlds. Such ZDLC thrives in environment.<br /><br />We start by the business drivers of the organization Which are as follows:<br /><br />To capture Requirements for projects / programs (Including new projects) more Effectively, que le Ensuring customer Receives the downstream benefits of higher quality deliverables and innovation.<br />To bring more agility to the current approach to project definition Waterfall and delivery, distinct from a Purely agile approach.<br />We were Asked to comeback with experience of helping our customers address challenges and How They contention may be applicable to the organization in question. We have beens working for some time with customers who Have had similar challenges and Concerns. The outcome and experience from thesis allowed us to commitments HAS economic development of a new platform, the Zero Deviation Life Cycle (ZDLC).<br /><br />By using Cognizant's platform ZDLC We have Achieved the Following Measurable benefits:<br /><br />20-25% saving in the cost of e Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)) delivery<br />40% -50% reduction in the cost of quality in media and maintenance cycles<br />The platform ZDLC aussi Ensures a better decision-making process, leading to oa Higher degree of project success. This is Achieved through a structured, yet unrestricted, requirement gathering process, Establishing consistent communication across life cycle stages and controlled impact analysis.<br /><br />ZDLC is a platform comprised of the Following That main tools:<br /><br />(HOQ-e) - House of Quality enhanced<br />(TRIZ-e) - Theory of Inventive Problem Solving<br />(RMS-e) - Requirement Modeling Solution<br />(TiA-e) - Testable Integration Architecture n<br />(CPN-e) - Coloured Petri Nets<br />(SDP-e) - Systemic Defect Profiler<br />These are used by customer and joined Cognizant teams across the project life cycle. The platform is based on ZDLC some key principles to approach offers year of development Which is a scientific and quantitative means clustering of managing and measuring ever-changing requirements. This Provides the Ability for each Stock exchange requirement to be mathematically and analysed Assessed against the impact of the exchange across business processes. ZDLC HAS allowed our customers to:<br /><br />instigate a Culture of Innovation Within Measurable and sustainable t the program lifecycle<br />track requirement through the SDLC, Providing a consistent communication mechanism<br />prioritizes Requirements and bring consistency across SDLC, injecting great agility into the process<br />Eliminate contradictions Within a solution<br />minimizes defects Throughout The SDLC and Thereby Reduce cost<br />In thesis commitments ZDLC Increases the power of modeling software applications and innovative solutions at Creating space. WHILST Cognizant HAS dedicated agile team, We Were empowered by the organization's focus to Bringing Greater agility to the current way of working waterfall Rather Than Introducing the agile methodology.<br /><br />Detailed below are two examples of how agility ZDLC added to the standard Waterfall methodology ALLOWING our customers realized significant benefits to.<br /><br />To Prove the benefit of the new approach was a comparison exercise Undertaken. Two streams of work started at the same Were time to solve the same problem. The objective was to gather Produce Sufficient Requirements and technical specifications to meet a project need. The team using a classic Waterfall approach Took 15 days to the full task, the team Whereas using ZDLC Took only 3 days (due to smart automation).<br />The second example is using e Focuses ZDLC to bring innovation to a customer's on-line platform. Were The Aims to Increase the number of functional software releases over a 12 month period from 1 to 4 and Deliver a reduction in the cost of quality. ZDLC allowed the team to Deliver 42% reduction in cost of a quality and in the first six months two functional releases Have Been Delivered putting the customer c on-track to meet Their business goals. In addition ZDLC major design flaws found 3 que les classical waterfall approach failed to identify.<br />The approach adds significant value ZDLC to bring rigor and agility to waterfall to agile tools and the principle has-beens Carefully crafted to Achieve this.<br /><br />The Tools<br /><br />The House of Quality (HOQ-e), adapted to the problem domain of IT for Requirements Engineering and business requirement traceability to Strengthen reliable communication Amongst the stakeholders of the ZDLC.<br /><br />Inputs: Structured questioning, Aligned Business and Architectural Analysis, Customer decision making process engaged.<br />Outputs: Prioritised and dependency aware work packages and building consensus across teams.<br />Benefits: Auditable alignment to goals, pattern-based solution definition, strategic alignment and Powerful decision-support.<br />The Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ-e) Adapted to the problem domain of IT for innovative solution-focused definition.<br /><br />Inputs: HOQ analysis (re-used), prioritised list of contradictions to solve.<br />Outputs: Contextualised and Measurable Innovation of options.<br />Benefits: Directed ideation process off, That ideas generated meet reliability needs and can be n Measured before building.<br />Requirement Modelling Solution (RMS-e) Used to model and compile user requirements, model process flow diagram for each Stock user requirement and generate test scenarios for each Stock process flow diagram.<br /><br />Inputs: HOQ analysis (re-used), prioritised list of contradictions to solve.<br />Outputs: Generated Software Requirement Documents (SRDS), Process Flow diagrams and Test Cases.<br />Benefits: Accelerated process of requirement modeling and automated the process of Generating SRD requirement and audits.<br />Testable Integration Architecture (TiA-e) Used for low-level consistency requirement, verification of design against Requirements and generation of artifacts Validated to drive delivery and to assist in governance.<br /><br />Inputs: RMS-e artifacts (re-used) 100% transparent process and design decisions prioritised entities for communication.<br />Outputs: Industry-standard m testable models generated against Requirements and technical contracts.<br />Benefits: Auditable Requirements to alignment, notionally formal, technical contracts to drive development and testing, Earlier and more comprehensive defect detection, requirements consistency, lower cost of quality.<br />Coloured Petri Nets (CPN-e) Adapted to process modeling and non-Functional Requirements and simulation of models against Them.<br /><br />Inputs: e-HOQ analysis (re-used), prioritised process-entities.<br />Outputs: Machine readable deployment model for solutions.<br />Benefits: Deployment model can be simulated against non-Functional Requirements, capacity planning, stress testing support, early defect detections, lower cost of quality.<br />Systemic Defect Profiler (SDP-e) for automated root cause analysis.<br /><br />Inputs: TiA models, log files from development work streams or network layer data.<br />Outputs: Formal analysis from design-time to run reconciliation, sanitation logging.<br />Benefits: True, enabled Governance, faster root cause analysis.

Each of the processes Requires efforts to Avoid waste and agility to speed up the end results. There are challenges and Risks That Are required to be Diagnosed and Treated.<br /><br />Any Risks facing Agile Execution<br /><br />There are key issues need to be Answered That in order to model the solution to Mitigate the Risks.

This process is tedious and time consuming and very Often Incorrectly Handled may result if to unyielding Developing capabilities to the business stakeholders. As a result of the validation user stories is Necessary, Which leads to the next question.<br /><br />Once the vision of the business is in place, how do we instigate a process of validating and Verifying Consistently the user stories against the vision. The consequence of failing this exercise will lead to reworks as user stories will be Either 1) not reflecting the needs of the business (validation) or 2) incorrect formulation of user stories against a predefined set of best practices (verification). This exercise of validation and verification (V &amp; V) is time consuming, and may not be thorough since V &amp; V may be Sacrificed for speed leading to more rework and a growing backlog of the Agile product lifecycle.<br /><br />Product backlog grooming is a vital activity in year Agile environment and getting this process right defines the success of delivery. There is a continuous need to treat the backlog as new user stories user stories or incorrect stream into the backlog queue. Backlog grooming is a repetitive task of re-Prioritising and re-mapping the inter-relationships of user stories so as to design the next sprints efficiently. As the Product Backlog Increases in size, the efforts required to re-prioritizes and prioritizes Increases and the human error will it increase. Incorrect leads to incorrect priority scheduling of sprints.<br /><br />In the next issue of Addressing Risks, we Discuss on the problematic handling of large volume of work and manual overhead associated to the establishment and treatment of test cases for each Stock user story. This problem Hinders the flow of activities and slow downs the process of Agile. The Creation of test cases is tedious and time consuming and as seen in classical state of affairs thesis are Formulated test cases manually. The lath allows for human Injected defects in the test cases Which Requires extra effort to 1) correct the test cases and 2) keep the test cases and user stories in sync.<br /><br />The last issue addresses the challenge of Consistently Ensuring Knowledge is managed across a distributed and complex program. Ideally, the perception of a Given user story in the eyes of a Business Analysts shoulds be the same for the test or the Developer and so on. It is required to Achieve a common understanding of the description of requirements. Yet the complexity of social dynamics and geographical dispersion of the program transform this activity into a very challenging and risky outcome. If the knowledge is not Correctly managed, communication Amongst peers of the development process is ambiguous and unclear, and waste resulting and to defects in the agile process. Subsequently the product backlog grows.<br />The consequences of thesis Risks in Agile year execution lead to waste, poor quality, low yield and growing cost to the customer. Like Any process, an Agile process aussi Subjected to entropy, and work to be done HAS to minimize the waste so que le value of agility and speed is not loss. Now the issue is: Work That Has to be done can be done manually or Either with the help of some smart tools and techniques.<br /><br />Are we comfortable handling thesis Risks manually or do we agree That thesis challenges warrant a tools-based mitigation approach? If the answer is yes, then follow part 2 of the blog, Wherein we present the Zero Deviation Agile Enablement Product Life Cycle. The lath was designed to blend seamlessly process automation and formal mathematical rigor into the capability of Agile. It adds rigor to agility agility without hurting aim augmenting it.<br /><br />Background<br /><br />"The ZDLC (Zero Deviation Life Cycle) is a platform and suite of tools developed by Cognizant with the vision of am&eacute;liorer the efficiency, quality and cost of building IT systems".<br /><br />It Achieves this by enforcing the Following principles:<br /><br />Directly Addressing how errors INITIALLY get Introduced into the development lifecycle WIDER<br />Reducing the onward communication of errors into Subsequent phases of the development lifecycle<br />Giving structure to Requirements gathering ALLOWING problem and solution patterns to be Formally APPROBATION - enabling Re-Use<br />Automating the determination of the root-cause of Remaining errors / defects in products<br />Introducing sustainable innovation as the share of product delivery Culture<br />We Recognise That There are Many contexts Where aussi Such abilities may be needed, so the ZDLC has-been designed to be:<br /><br />Executed in Any style of implementation eg Iterative (RUP), Agile (SCRUM) ..<br />Used with Any technology-stack (eg JavaEE,. NET, Mainframe, Open Source, ..) with equal efficacit&eacute;<br />Adopted without Needing to re-train or exchange to make traditional SDLC roles<br />Applied to Projects IN ANY form or stage - New Build, Migration, Transformation, .. or Planned, In-flight, Post Go-Live ..<br />Purchased all together or individual tools Purchased and used separately<br />The ZDLC Suite of Tools<br /><br />A tool in the smallest entity ZDLC is ZDLC of the framework. A tool is a software That we built automata and Enforces the principles of ZDLC. A tool is designed to solve generic problems of development life cycles requirement Such as validation, checking of design artifacts for design defects and testing and performance of functions on the products. The Following table depicts the tools created to support the practice and PLC Fundamental Principles of the Framework ZDLC.<br /><br />The ZDLC Product<br /><br />The Products of ZDLC Were designed to resolve specific problems of IT enabled business processes. A product, in our context, is a logical grouping of the ZDLC tools (see table above), to solve a specific problem Within a customer engagement. The Following table presents The Most Popular products ZDLC That Employ the tools to resolve business problems and show Measurable business value by enacting the Fundamental Principles of ZDLC.<br /><br />Zero Deviation Life Cycle: Objective Innovation (OI)<br /><br />Background<br /><br />Objective Innovation (OI) is a product Which employs the Zero Deviation Life Cycle (ZDLC) Framework to instigate a process of constant innovation and sustainable Within The problem year dynamics of organization. IO supports a collaborative services for Delivering innovation in business and IT for customers new That Utilizes techniques and methodologies against Purely business problems and opportunities. OI included a problem and a solution factory factory That Provide a highly focussed together (focus vs beam of idea. Idea of &#8203;&#8203;spectrum a) Measurable and repeatable innovation model.<br /><br />The Problem Factory<br /><br />The problem included two factory tools (AHP and HoQe) ZDLC of the framework. The aim of the problem is to factory Ensure the right problems are APPROBATION for innovative and creative problem solving. In order to get the right problem, a sophisticated process of validating the problem vis-a-vis the business goals and drivers is Implemented.<br />AHP-e: The Analytical Hierarchy Process is used for high level pair-wise prioritization of needs, wants and problems, Which Enables the subjective process of priority &eacute;valuer the weightage of arbitrary attribute more consistent and repeatable.<br />HOQ-e: The House of Quality enhanced, is used to drill down the problem statement from stakeholders and Their Functions using statistical methods to Provide a balanced view of the traceable wants, needs and problems. HoQe aussi identified the contradictions problems indicating indication Amongst Those problems requiring innovative solutions and Creating.<br />The Solution Factory<br /><br />The solution included two factory tools (TRIZ and TiA) of the Framework ZDLC. The aim of the solution is to factory focus on the innovative and creative problems solving, to re-enforce and Requirements To Provide early assessment of solutions, in terms of Risks, Risks mitigation, process and exchange high level implementation plan illustrating the journey from innovative idea to solution over an existing or new technology.<br />TRIZ-e: The Theory of Inventive Problem Solving feeds Directly From HoQe and Provides a repeatable model to focus ideas and Reinforce the process of ideation ounce APPROBATION problem has-beens. Using TRIZ year Ensures efficient ideation process.<br />TiA EMail: Testable Integration Architecture, a set of tools That Ensures That architectures meet Requirements through formal testing of models against Requirements Prior to coding.<br />Using the OI product there is a potential saving from 50% to technical problems Requirements to contracts. In the context of innovation it Provides early assessment of Requirements and Provides solutions against re-enforcement of requirements.<br /><br />Background<br /><br />The challenges Involved in migrating from one technology to another are complex and plagued with cost and schedule overrun. The problem related to the very Often a fait que organization HAS Given several technologies, eg BPM technology and wants to rationalize by Consolidating onto a single product suite, but some platforms are undocumented and unclear:<br /><br />10 + year old platform without proper documentation Any<br />Customer facing significant financial outlay unwanted if not off by platform due dates<br />Operations team no longer Knew ALL of underpinning functions on adhoc components with significant added<br />Fear of loss of service if process was 'rushed' but limited budget and Subject Matter Experts (SME) 'face time' available<br />The smart migration product employs the principles of the Zero Deviation Life Cycle (ZDLC) and proposed a fast and reliable approach to Mitigating the Risks Involved in technology migration programs. The key element of the approach are as follows:<br /><br />Semi-automated reverse engineering of legacy system from Log Files with minimal demand on SMEs' time<br />Transcribed legacy system into industry-standard design testable models and simulations to test models Performed Prior to implementation<br />Fully automated generation of notationally Model-correct specifications (eg BPMN 2.0 and UML) to Improve the quality, correctness and efficacit&eacute; Target platform to modeling<br />The outcome of the Implementing Smart Migration Systematically solution to infer the complete behavior of the source system through conventional means clustering Otherwise not with the objective of re-instating the complete documentation set and simulation capability for system.

As a result, early detection of potential defects, makes the cost and risk of change affordable with faster, safer and higher quality execution. An innate property of the migration process is smart Enacted by the Reinstatement of accurate, up-to-date documentation Which Reduces cost of on-wards support. It bring platform 'under control' and re-enable delivery of value to the Customers / Users / Business. The long term implication of Deploying the product constitutes smart migration to the problematic of Facilitating Knowledge Transfer (KT) without significant critical SME's Demands on time and more importantly Stabilize program or project level velocity.<br /><br />In summary, Smart Migration Demonstrates systematic automation of a highly manual and error-prone process to Provide a clear, accurate and reliable determination of system behavior in year Existing efficient, low risk and impact way. Through the use of simulation techniques, it tests the proper alignment of Existing system behavior to target architecture or updated models to subsequently translate the models into implementation specifications eg BPMN2.0 and UML.<br /><br />The Following diagram depicts the process model of the Smart Migration product, a process to map and compare ADOPTED Voice of the machine against the Voice of the Business That is so reliable and risk-free journey of migration can be traced Systematically.<br /><br />The Life Cycle Zero Deviation: Smart Architecture Modelling<br /><br />Background<br /><br />With The Expanding Role of IT as a key enabler to the success and growth of organizations, the typical systems increasingly complex Become HAS estate, with growing use of Specialised applications to supporting various business functions.

<h2 style="text-align:left;">Software Testing Life Cycle</h2>
<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;display:block;"><font color="#000000">Software Testing Life Cycle<br />The software testing life cycle consists of various testing activities that need to be carried out to validate if the software meets the required design specification. It also explains which testing activity needs to be carried out and when. The different phases of the software testing process have been explained in this article. Read on.<br /><br /><br />The software testing life cycle consists of a series of stages through which a software product goes through and describes the various activities pertaining to testing that are carried out on the product. Here's an explanation of the STLC along with a flowchart.<br /><br />Introduction to Software Testing Life Cycle<br /><br />In every organization testing is an important phase in the development of a software product. However, the way it is carried out differs from one organization to another. It is advisable to carry out the testing process from the initial stages, with regard to the Software Development Life Cycle or SDLC to avoid any complications.<br /><br />Software Testing Phases<br /><br />Software testing has its own life cycle that meets every stage of the SDLC. The software testing life cycle diagram can help one understand its various phases. They are:<br />Requirement Stage<br />Test Planning<br />Test Analysis<br />Test Design<br />Test Verification and Construction<br />Test Execution<br />Result Analysis<br />Bug Tracking<br />Reporting and Rework<br />Final Testing and Implementation<br />Post Implementation<br /><br />Requirement Stage<br />This is the initial stage of the software testing process. In this phase the developers take part in analyzing the requirements for designing a product. The role of software testers is also necessary in this phase as they can think from the 'users' point of view which the developers may not. Thus a team of developers, testers and users can be formed, to analyze the requirements of the product. Formal meetings of the team can be held in order to document the requirements which can further be used as software requirements specification or SRS.<br /><br />Test Planning<br />Test planning means to predetermine a plan well in advance to reduce further risks. A well-designed test plan document plays an important role in achieving a process-oriented approach. Once the requirements of the project are confirmed, a test plan is documented. The test plan structure is as follows:<br />Introduction: This describes the objective of the test plan.<br />Test Items: The items that are required to prepare this document will be listed here such as SRS, project plan.<br />Features to be tested: This describes the coverage area of the test plan, that is, the list of features to be tested; that are based on the implicit and explicit requirements from the customer.<br />Features not to be tested: The incorporated or comprised features that can be skipped from the testing phase are listed here. Features that are out of scope of testing, like incomplete modules or those on low severity, for example, GUI features that don't hamper the process can be included in the list.<br />Approach: This is the test strategy that should be appropriate to the level of the plan. It should be in acceptance with the higher and lower levels of the plan.<br />Item pass/fail criteria: Related to the show stopper issue. The criteria used has to explain which test item has passed or failed.<br />Suspension criteria and resumption requirements: The suspension criteria specifies the criteria that is to be used to suspend all or a portion of the testing activities, whereas resumption criteria specifies when testing can resume with the suspended portion.<br />Test deliverable: This includes a list of documents, reports, charts that are required to be presented to the stakeholders on a regular basis during the testing process and after its completion.<br />Testing tasks: This phase lists the testing tasks that need to be performed. This includes conducting the tests, evaluating the results and documenting them based on the test plan designed. This also helps users and testers to avoid incomplete functions and prevent waste of resources.<br />Environmental needs: The special requirements of the test plan depending on the environment in which the application has to be designed are listed here.<br />Responsibilities: This phase assigns responsibilities to people who can be held responsible in case of a risk.<br />Staffing and training needs: Training on the application/system and on the testing tools to be used needs to be explained to the staff members who are responsible for the application.<br />Risks and contingencies: This emphasizes on the probable risks and various events that can occur and what can be done in such situations.<br />Approval: This decides who can approve the process as complete and allow the project to proceed to the next level that depends on the level of the plan.<br />Test Analysis<br />Once the test plan documentation is done, the next stage is to analyze what types of software testing should be carried out at the various stages of SDLC.&nbsp;<br /><br />Test Design<br />Test design is done based on the requirements of the project documented in the SRS. This phase decides whether manual or automated testing is to be done. In automation testing, different paths for testing are to be identified first and writing of scripts has to be done if required. An end-to-end checklist that covers all the features of the project is necessary in the test design process.<br /><br />Test Verification and Construction<br />In this phase, the test plan, test design and automated test script are completed. Stress and performance testing plans are also completed at this stage. When the development team is done with a unit of code, the testing team is required to help them in testing that unit and report any bug in the product, if found. Integration testing and bug reporting is done in this phase of software testing.<br /><br />Test Execution<br />Planning and execution of various test cases is done in this phase. Once the unit testing is completed, the functionality of the tests is done in this phase. At first, top-level testing is done to find out the top-level failures and bugs are reported immediately to the development team to get the required workaround. Test reports have to be documented properly and the bugs have to be reported to the development team.<br /><br />Result Analysis<br />After the successful execution of the test case, the testing team has to retest it to compare the expected values with the actual values, and declare the result as pass/fail.<br /><br />Bug Tracking<br />This is one of the important stages as the Defect Profile Document (DPD) has to be updated for letting the developers know about the defect. Defect Profile Document contains the following<br />Defect Id: Unique identification of the Defect.<br />Test Case Id: Test case identification for that defect.<br />Description: Detailed description of the bug.<br />Summary: This field contains some keyword information about the bug, which can help in minimizing the number of records to be searched.<br />Defect Submitted By: Name of the tester who detected/reported the bug.<br />Date of Submission: Date at which the bug was detected and reported.<br />Build No.: Number of test runs required.<br />Version No.: The version information of the software application in which the bug was detected and fixed.<br />Assigned To: Name of the developer who is supposed to fix the bug.<br />Severity: Degree of severity of the defect.<br />Priority: Priority of fixing the bug.<br />Status: This field displays current status of the bug.<br />Reporting and Rework<br />Testing is an iterative process. The bug that is reported and fixed by the development team, has to undergo the testing process again to assure that the bug found has been resolved. Regression testing has to be done. Once the Quality Analyst assures that the product is ready, the software is released for production. Before release, the software has to undergo one more round of top-level testing. Thus testing is an ongoing process.<br /><br />Final Testing and Implementation<br />This phase focuses on the remaining levels of testing, such as acceptance, load, stress, performance and recovery testing. The application needs to be verified under specified conditions with respect to the SRS. Various documents are updated and different matrices for testing are completed at this stage of software testing.<br /><br />Post Implementation<br />Once the test results are evaluated, the recording of errors that occurred during the various levels of the testing process, is done. Creating plans for improvement and enhancement is an ongoing process. This helps to prevent similar problems from occurring in the future projects. In short, planning for improvement of the testing process for future applications is done in this phase.<br /><br />Software defects are not always caused by coding errors. In fact, requirement gaps can also result in errors in an application. Though software testing can be carried out at any stage in the development phase, the process is mostly implemented after the requirements for an application have been specified and the coding has been completed.</font><br /><br /><br /></div></div>
